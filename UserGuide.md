# Introduction #

In this document the different ways on how Kanbanik can be set up and how to do this will be shown.

# Personal Kanban Design Patterns #
In this section two patterns from Personal Kanban Design Patterns from Jim Benson and Tonianne DeMaria Barry's book will be used.

## Balanced Throughput Approach ##
The example of this pattern is shown below.

On the next screenshot you can see how to achieve this. Just have 3 horizontal items (Ready, Doing, Done). Than, add 5 vertical sub items to the Doing item.

## Large Project Approach ##
The example of this pattern is shown below (well, the original had more workflowitems in the Writing Book...).

On the next screenshot you can see how to achieve this. First you need to have two vertical items (Normal, Writing Book). The Normal has three horizontal sub-items (Ready, Doing, Done). Please note, that the Doing has a WIP limit of 3, the other items does  not. Than, the Writing Book has four horizontal sub-items (Backlog, Pre-Writing, Focus, Final).
